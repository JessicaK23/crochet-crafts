    <p class="hero-text"> Hello, my name is Deirdre and I am delighted to have you visit my cozy little corner
        of the internet. Crochet crafts is a place for me to share my projects and love for crochet.
        My love for making things, wether it be personal photo frames, hand-made jewelery or crafted gifts for loved ones,
        is what encouraged me to explore and discover crochet. I have endless opportunities to craft with crochet, if you
        are like me who loves to make things, or are new to crochet, perhaps have experience with crochet, this space is for you
        and I hope it inspires to you delve into crochet!
        Lets dive in!</p>
